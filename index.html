        <h1>Evan Crook</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my personal page. I'm glad you're here.</p> 
        <p>I work as a software engineer. My interests and experience generally cluster around "big data", ETL, distributed systems, concurrency, performance improvements, natural language processing, programming languages and compilers, ...
        <br/>
        At heart, though, I just love building software that is clean, performant,
        innovative, and pleasant to use.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>I have lots of ideas and half-finished side projects. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This website -- very much a work in progress; currently it is a single hand-written html file.
                Someday soon(tm) I'll set up a blog and a static site generator.</li>

            <li>Learning compilers, and Rust, at the same time by reading <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>
                and building a toy language called <a href=https://github.com/evdc/sprout-rs>Sprout</a>.</li>

            <li>Reading about distributed systems, programming languages, reactive/incremental logic programming, etc.,
                and discovering various <a href="http://witheve.com">strange</a> and <a href="http://cell-lang.net/">fascinating</a> <a href="https://ap5.com/">projects</a> in that space.
            </li>

            <li>Designing a relational scripting language for game development (this one has the least likelihood of coming to fruition anytime soon).</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>

        <p>When away from a computer screen, I enjoy board games and chasing my toddler around the house. In the Before Times, I was a fan of hiking, camping, skiing, and exploring new restaurants.</p>
        <p>I live in Minneapolis, MN, the land of snow and forests and passive-aggressive people.</p>
