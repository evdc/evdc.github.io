          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my personal page. I'm glad you're here.</p> 
            <p>I work as a software engineer, with 8 years of experience in software and data engineering. 
                My interests and experience generally cluster around "big data", ETL, distributed systems, concurrency, performance improvements, natural language processing, programming languages and compilers, ...
            <br/><br/>
            At heart, though, I just love building software that is clean, performant, innovative, and pleasant to use.</p>

                and building <a href=https://github.com/evdc/sprout-rs>Sprout</a>, an experimental relational scripting language.

            <li>Reading about distributed systems, programming languages, reactive/incremental logic programming, etc.,
                and discovering various <a href="http://witheve.com">strange</a> and <a href="http://cell-lang.net/">fascinating</a> <a href="https://ap5.com/">projects</a> in that space.
